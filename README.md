# TS_Practic_1
> ## First practical lesson on **TypeScript**

> 1. Create your own repository, with two main and develop options. Create a short Readme file and briefly describe what this repository is about in English language. 
> 2. Under the develop checkbox, create the feature/js-to-ts checkbox.
> 3. In feature/js-to-ts, create a file index.js and add 200 lines of JavaScript code there.
> 4. Rewrite the JavaScript code by adding the type (number, boolean, string) without installing TypeScript and without changing the extension to the index.js file.
> 5. Submit all changes, create a pull request from develop and generate revenue.
> 6. Post a message to the repository.
